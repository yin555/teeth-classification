  abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can reveal detailed white matter anatomy
	and has the potential to detect abnormalities in specific white matter
	structures. Such detection and quantification are, however, not straightforward.
	The voxel-based analysis after image normalization is one of the
	most widely used methods for quantitative image analyses. To apply
	this approach to DTI, it is important to examine if structures in
	the white matter are well registered among subjects, which would
	be highly dependent on employed algorithms for normalization. In
	this paper, we evaluate the accuracy of normalization of DTI data
	using a highly elastic transformation algorithm, called large deformation
	diffeomorphic metric mapping. After simulation-based validation of
	the algorithm, DTI data from normal subjects were used to measure
	the registration accuracy. To examine the impact of morphological
	abnormalities on the accuracy, the algorithm was also tested using
	data from Alzheimer 's disease (AD) patients with severe brain atrophy.
	The accuracy level was measured by using manual landmark-based white
	matter matching and surface-based brain and ventricle matching as
	gold standard. To improve the accuracy level, cascading and multi-contrast
	approaches were developed. The accuracy level for the white matter
	was 1.88+/-0.55 and 2.19+/-0.84 mm for the measured locations in
	the controls and patients, respectively.},

	the diffeomorphic transformation from one to the other; (ii) the
	computation of empirical probability laws of anatomical variation
	between anatomies; and (iii) the construction of inferences regarding
	neuropsychiatric disease states. CA utilizes spatial-temporal vector
	field information obtained from large-deformation maps to assess
	anatomical variabilities and facilitate the detection and quantification
	of abnormalities of brain structure in subjects with neuropsychiatric
	disorders. Neuroanatomical structures are divided into two types:
	subcortical structures-gray matter (GM) volumes enclosed by a single
	surface-and cortical mantle structures-anatomically distinct portions
	of the cerebral cortical mantle layered between the white matter
	(WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Because of fundamental differences
	in the geometry of these two types of structures, image-based large-deformation
	high-dimensional brain mapping (HDBM-LD) and large-deformation diffeomorphic
	metric matching (LDDMM) were developed for the study of subcortical
	structures and labeled cortical mantle distance mapping (LCMDM) was
	developed for the study of cortical mantle structures. Studies of
	neuropsychiatric disorders using CA usually require the testing of
	hypothesized group differences with relatively small numbers of subjects
	per group. Approaches that increase the power for testing such hypotheses
	include methods to quantify the shapes of individual structures,
	relationships between the shapes of related structures (e.g., asymmetry),
	and changes of shapes over time. Promising preliminary studies employing
	these approaches to studies of subjects with schizophrenia and very
	mild to mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) are presented.},

  abstract = {Structural deformity of the hippocampus is characteristic of individuals
	with very mild and mild forms of dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT).
	The purpose of this study was to determine whether a similar deformity
	of the hippocampus can predict the onset of dementia in nondemented
	elders. Using high dimensional diffeomorphic transformations of a
	neuroanatomical template, hippocampal volumes and surfaces were defined
	in 49 nondemented elders; the hippocampal surface was subsequently
	partitioned into three zones (i.e., lateral, superior and inferior-medial),
	which were proximal to the underlying CA1 subfield, CA2-4 subfields
	plus dentate gyrus, and subiculum, respectively. Annual clinical
	assessments using the Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR), where
	CDR 0 indicates no dementia and CDR 0.5 indicates very mild dementia,
	were then performed for a mean of 4.9 years (range 0.9-7.1 years)
	to monitor subjects who converted from CDR 0 to CDR 0.5. Inward variation
	of t he lateral zone and left hippocampal volume significantly predicted
	conversion to CDR 0.5 in separate Cox proportional hazards models.
	When hippocampal surface variation and volume were included in a
	single model, inward variation of the lateral zone of the left hippocampal
	surface was selected as the only significant predictor of conversion.
	The pattern of hippocampal surface deformation observed in nondemented
	subjects who later converted to CDR 0.5 was similar to the pattern
	of hippocampal surface deformation previously observed to discriminate
	subjects with very mild DAT and nondemented subjects. These results
	suggest that inward deformation of the left hippocampal surface in
	a zone corresponding to the CA1 subfield is an early predictor of
	the onset of DAT in nondemented elderly subjects.},

  abstract = {Regression analysis is a powerful tool for the study of changes in
	a dependent variable as a function of an independent regressor variable,
	and in particular it is applicable to the study of anatomical growth
	and shape change. When the underlying process can be modeled by parameters
	in a Euclidean space, classical regression techniques are applicable
	and have been studied extensively. However, recent work suggests
	that attempts to describe anatomical shapes using flat Euclidean
	spaces undermines our ability to represent natural biological variability.
	In this paper we develop a method for regression analysis of general,
	manifold-valued data. Specifically, we extend Nadaraya-Watson kernel
	regression by recasting the regression problem in terms of Frechet
	expectation. Although this method is quite general, our driving problem
	is the study anatomical shape change as a function of age from random
	design image data. We demonstrate our method by analyzing shape change
	in the brain from a random design dataset of MR images of 89 healthy
	adults ranging in age from 22 to 79 years. To study the small scale
	changes in anatomy, we use the infinite dimensional manifold of diffeomorphic
	transformations, with an associated metric. We regress a representative
	anatomical shape, as a function of age, from this population.},

  abstract = {We propose a new methodology to analyze the anatomical variability
	of a set of longitudinal data (population scanned at several ages).
	This method accounts not only for the usual 3D anatomical variability
	(geometry of structures), but also for possible changes in the dynamics
	of evolution of the structures. It does not require that subjects
	are scanned the same number of times or at the same ages. First a
	regression model infers a continuous evolution of shapes from a set
	of observations of the same subject. Second, spatiotemporal registrations
	deform jointly (1) the geometry of the evolving structure via 3D
	deformations and (2) the dynamics of evolution via time change functions.
	Third, we infer from a set of subjects a prototype scenario of evolution
	and its 4D variability within the population. Our method is used
	to analyze the morphological evolution of 2D profiles of hominids
	skulls and to analyze brain growth from amygdala of autistics, developmental
	delay and control children.},

	data in Euclidean spaces. In this paper we formulate the geometric
	median of data on a Riemannian manifold as the minimizer of the sum
	of geodesic distances to the data points. We prove existence and
	uniqueness of the geometric median on manifolds with non-positive
	sectional curvature and give sufficient conditions for uniqueness
	on positively curved manifolds. Generalizing the Weiszfeld procedure
	for finding the geometric median of Euclidean data, we present an
	algorithm for computing the geometric median on an arbitrary manifold.
	We show that this algorithm converges to the unique solution when
	it exists. This method produces a robust central point for data lying
	on a manifold, and should have use in a variety of vision applications
	involving manifolds. We give examples of the geometric median computation
	and demonstrate its robustness for three types of manifold data:
	the 3D rotation group, t ensor manifolds, and shape spaces.},

  abstract = {The cingulate gyri in 37 subjects with and without early dementia
	of the Alzheimer type (DAT) were studied by using MRI at 1.0 mm3
	isotropic resolution. Groups were segregated into young controls
	(n = 10), age-matched normal controls (n = 10), very mild DAT (n
	= 8), and mild DAT (n = 9). By using automated Bayesian segmentation
	of the cortex and gray matter/white matter (GM/WM) isosurface generation,
	tissue compartments were labeled into gray, white, and cerebrospinal
	fluid as a function of distance from the GM/WM isosurface. Cortical
	mantle distance maps are generated profiling the GM volume and cortical
	mantle distribution as a function of distance from the cortical surface.
	Probabilistic tests based on generalizations of Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney
	tests were applied to quantify cortical mantle distribution changes
	with normal and abnormal aging. We find no significant change between
	young controls and healthy aging as measured by the GM volume and
	cortical mantle d istribution as a function of distance in both anterior
	and posterior regions of the cingulate. Significant progression of
	GM loss is seen in the very mild DAT and mild DAT groups in all areas
	of the cingulate. Posterior regions show both GM volume loss as well
	as significant cortical mantle distribution decrease with the onset
	of mild DAT. The "shape of the cortical mantle" as measured by the
	cortical mantle distance profiles manifests a pronounced increase
	in variability with mild DAT.},

  abstract = {Neuroanatomical endophenotypes may reveal insights into the processes
	by which genetic factors increase the risk of developing schizophrenia.
	To determine whether patterns of neuroanatomical asymmetries may
	be useful as schizophrenia-related endophenotypes, we compared patterns
	of structural asymmetries in patients with schizophrenia, healthy
	controls, and their respective siblings. The surfaces of the left
	and right amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, caudate nucleus, putamen,
	globus pallidus, and nucleus accumbens were assessed in 40 pairs
	of healthy comparison controls (CON) and their siblings (CON-SIB)
	and 25 pairs of patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) and their siblings
	(SCZ-SIB) in magnetic resonance (MR) images using large deformation
	diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM) and parallel transport techniques.
	The within-subject asymmetry deformation of each structure was first
	measured via LDDMM, and then translated to a global template via
	parallel transport for evaluation of the patterns of asymmetry both
	within and across siblings. Our results revealed that asymmetries
	observed in CON subjects occurred in the amygdala and the anterior
	segment of the hippocampus with more pronounced expansion deformation
	in the right-sided structures (R>L asymmetry) but not in the basal
	ganglia and thalamus. Disturbance in this pattern of asymmetries
	was observed in both SCZ and SCZ-SIB subjects. More specifically,
	exaggerations and reductions in the normative pattern of asymmetries
	were observed in the amygdala-hippocampus formation, basal ganglia,
	and thalamus. These altered patterns of asymmetries are present in
	subjects with schizophrenia and their siblings, and therefore may
	represent a schizophrenia-related endophenotype.},

  abstract = {To better define the pattern of hippocampal deformity early in the
	course of Alzheimer's disease, we compared the pattern of hippocampal
	surface variation in subjects with very mild dementia of the Alzheimer
	type (DAT) and nondemented subjects. The surface of the hippocampus
	was divided a priori on a neuroanatomical template into three zones
	approximating the locations of underlying subfields [Csernansky,
	J.G., Wang, L., Swank, J., Miller, J.P., Gado, M., McKeel, D., Miller,
	M.I., Morris, J.C., 2005. Preclinical detection of Alzheimer's disease:
	hippocampal shape and volume predict dementia onset in the elderly.
	NeuroImage 25, 783--792]; i.e., a lateral zone (LZ) approximating
	the CA1 subfield, a superior zone (SZ) approximating the combined
	CA2, CA3, CA4 subfields and the gyrus dentatus (GD), and an inferior-medial
	zone (IMZ) approximating the subiculum. Large-deformation high-dimensional
	brain mapping (HDBM-LD) was used to generate the hippocampal surfaces
	of a ll subjects and to register the surface zones across subjects.
	Average variations within each zone were calculated for the subjects
	with very mild DAT as compared to the average of the nondemented
	subjects. After correcting for multiple comparisons, the very mild
	DAT subjects showed significant inward variation in the left and
	right LZ, the left and right IMZ, but not in the left and right SZ
	as compared to nondemented subjects. In logistic regression analyses,
	inward variation of the left and right LZ or IMZ by 0.1 mm relative
	to the average of the nondemented subjects increased the odds of
	the subject being a very mild DAT subject (range-1.18 to 1.57) rather
	than being a nondemented subject. The odds ratios for the left and
	right SZ were not significant. These results represent a replication
	of our previous findings [Csernansky, J.G., Wang, L., Joshi, S.,
	Miller, J.P., Gado, M., Kido, D., McKeel, D., Morris, J.C., Miller,
	M.I., 2000. Early DAT is distinguished from aging b y high-dimensional
	mapping of the hippocampus. Neurology 55,! 1636--1 643.] and suggest
	that inward deformities of the hippocampal surface in proximity to
	the CA1 subfield and subiculum can be used to distinguish subjects
	with very mild DAT from nondemented subjects.},

  abstract = {Rates of hippocampal volume loss have been shown to distinguish subjects
	with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) from nondemented controls.
	In this study, we obtained magnetic resonance scans in 18 subjects
	with very mild DAT (CDR 0.5) and 26 age-matched nondemented controls
	(CDR 0) 2 years apart. Large-deformation high-dimensional brain mapping
	was used to quantify and compare changes in hippocampal shape as
	well as volume in the two groups of subjects. Hippocampal volume
	loss over time was significantly greater in the CDR 0.5 subjects
	(left = 8.3%, right = 10.2%) than in the CDR 0 subjects (left = 4.0%,
	right = 5.5%) (ANOVA, F = 7.81, P = 0.0078). We used singular-value
	decomposition and logistic regression models to quantify hippocampal
	shape change across time within individuals, and this shape change
	in the CDR 0.5 and CDR 0 subjects was found to be significantly different
	(Wilks's lambda, P = 0.014). Further, at baseline, CDR 0.5 subjects,
	in comparison t o CDR 0 subjects, showed inward deformation over
	38% of the hippocampal surface; after 2 years this difference grew
	to 47%. Also, within the CDR 0 subjects, shape change between baseline
	and follow-up was largely confined to the head of the hippocampus
	and subiculum, while in the CDR 0.5 subjects, shape change involved
	the lateral body of the hippocampus as well as the head region and
	subiculum. These results suggest that different patterns of hippocampal
	shape change in time as well as different rates of hippocampal volume
	loss distinguish very mild DAT from healthy aging.},

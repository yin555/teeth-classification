\subsection[Continuity of WF]{Continuity of $\WF$}
\begin{lemma}
\thlabel{th : continuity of WF}
The distance $\WF$ is continuous for the weak* topology on $\mathcal{M}_+(\Omega)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By the triangle inequality, we only need to show that if $\rho_n \rightharpoonup^* \rho$ then $\WF(\rho_n,\rho) \to 0$.
If $\rho = 0$, then $\WF(\rho, \rho_n) = \sqrt{2 \rho_n(\Omega)} \to 0$. Now assume $\rho \neq 0$ and also $\rho_n \neq 0$ (since it is true eventually).
We have 
\[
\WF(\rho, \rho_n) \leq \WF(\rho_n, \mnorm (\rho_{n})) + \WF(\rho,\mnorm (\rho_{n}))
\]
where $\mnorm (\rho_{n})$ is such that there exists $\alpha_n \in [0, + \infty[$, $\mnorm (\rho_{n})= \alpha_n \rho_{n}$ and $\mnorm (\rho_{n})(\Omega)=\rho(\Omega)$. Note that, by weak* convergence, we have that $\alpha_n \to 1$ and $W_2(\mnorm (\rho_{n}),\rho) \to 0$. But $\WF$ is upper bounded by Fisher-Rao and by $(1/2)W_2$, since those two metrics are obtained by taking the infimum of the same functional by adding the constraint $\omega=0$ and $\zeta=0$, respectively. Thus,
\[
\WF(\rho, \rho_{n}) \leq \delta|\sqrt{\alpha_n}-1|\sqrt{2 \rho_{n}(\Omega)} + (1/2) W_2(\mnorm (\rho_{n}),\rho) \to 0 \, . \qedhere
\]
\end{proof}

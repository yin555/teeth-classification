\section*{Conclusion}

When looking for generalizations of the dynamic optimal transport problem to unbalanced measures, a distance interpolating between optimal transport and Fisher-Rao metrics appears naturally. It is a natural Riemannian-like metric deriving from a family of convex homogeneous dynamic minimization problems. 
%
By analyzing the effect of varying the interpolation factor, and by studying geodesics for atomic measures, we obtained theoretical clues on how the model behaves.
These clues can be summarized by the two following interpretations: 
(i) the distance behaves as a spatially localized version of optimal transport, in the sense that mass whose supports are far away does not interact;
(ii) it also behaves as a regularized version of Fisher-Rao, in the sense that, unlike Fisher-Rao, it is stable by perturbation of the supports. This theoretical behavior is confirmed by the numerical experiments.
